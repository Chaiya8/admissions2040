# AdmitStack

AdmitStack is a web platform designed to improve equity in college admissions by centralizing critical application information in one accessible place. The platform reduces information gaps that disproportionately impact underrepresented and first-generation students by making admissions data easier to find, compare, and understand.

Built for the **Code2040 Tech for Resistance Hackathon**.

## Motivation

College admissions systems often advantage students with access to private counseling, paid tools, and institutional guidance. For many Black, Hispanic, first-generation, and low-income students, essential information—such as admissions requirements, application costs, financial aid indicators, and program opportunities is fragmented across multiple institutional sources.

This lack of transparency creates structural barriers to equitable college decision-making.

## What AdmitStack Does

AdmitStack aggregates and organizes college admissions resources into a single, navigable platform. Students can explore schools, opportunities, and peer-shared outcomes without needing to search across dozens of websites.

The platform is designed to support informed, confident decision-making throughout the college application process.

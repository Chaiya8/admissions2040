Admissions2040

A centralized platform that makes college admissions information easier to access and understand—especially for first-generation and underrepresented students.

Admissions2040 brings together admissions requirements, costs, financial aid indicators, opportunities, and student-shared results that are usually scattered across dozens of websites.

Built for the Code2040 Tech for Resistance Hackathon.

Problem

College admissions information is fragmented and hard to navigate. Students with access to private counselors and paid tools gain an advantage, while many Black, Hispanic, first-generation, and low-income students are left to search blindly for critical information like requirements, costs, and aid.

This information gap reinforces existing inequities in the admissions process.

Solution

Admissions2040 centralizes key admissions resources into one accessible platform. Instead of searching multiple sites, students can explore admissions data, opportunities, tips, and shared results in one place.

The MVP demonstrates how technology can reduce information barriers and support more equitable college decision-making.

Opportunities – Scholarships, programs, and resources students may qualify for

Results – Students share admissions outcomes and experiences to increase transparency
